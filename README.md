## dc.parallel-coordinates.js

Experiment of integrating [syntagmatic/parallel-coordinates](https://github.com/syntagmatic/parallel-coordinates) (via [BigFatDog/parcoords-es](https://github.com/BigFatDog/parcoords-es)) with [dc.js](https://github.com/syntagmatic/parallel-coordinates).

This doesn't work yet - unclear so far how the overlapping functionality can be merged. We'll see!
